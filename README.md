# TDD Project

In this project we implemented a class with some methods, but you will do it by doing test-driven development (TDD). The idea is to write tests first and then the code.

## Built With

- Ruby
- VSCode

## Set-up Rubocop GitHub Action

[Rubocop](https://www.rubocop.org/) is a Ruby static code analyzer (a.k.a. linter) and code formatter. It will enforce many of the guidelines outlined in the community [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/).
